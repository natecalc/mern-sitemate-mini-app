A lightweight application built to explore and understand the MERN stack components.

# 🔍 Overview
This mini app serves as a practical learning tool for understanding how the four core technologies of the MERN stack work together:

MongoDB - NoSQL database
Express - Web application framework
React - Frontend library
Node.js - JavaScript runtime environment

# 🚀 Purpose

This project is designed to provide hands-on experience with each layer of the MERN stack, with a particular focus on MongoDB and Express.

# 🛠️ Tech Stack

MongoDB: Document database for storing application data
Express: Backend framework for handling HTTP requests and responses
React: Frontend library for building user interfaces
Node.js: JavaScript runtime for server-side execution
